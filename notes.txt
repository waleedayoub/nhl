stats to add:
  
- games played - create pool member to team lookup and count team appearances
- goals (easy) - have it
- assists (easy) - have it
- points per game - easy if 1 is done

- points per game of remaining players
- n of players remaining

remaining teams -
  need a list of team tuples based on having the same gcode


create an algorithm that picks the optimal team based on how the selection process works
rank players from most points to least points and assume when given a turn, each particpant picks
the next best point getting player

then build a model that optimizes the players chosen based on other features:
  - some of those features would player based (points, goals, games played)
  - other features would be team based (likelihood to do well in the playoffs)

then compare the 2
if you allow a weighting for player vs team, then you get a comparison between -
  concentric: picking teams with odds of winning and working back
  contrarian: focusing on one team that most others ignore
  balanced: more teams based on early success
